        <p>I’m a curious person who loves learning new things, especially about technology, design, and writing. I’d say
            I’m calm, observant, and have a good sense of humor — sometimes a bit sarcastic, but always friendly. In my
            free time, I enjoy listening to music, watching movies, or going for walks while thinking about new ideas. I
            also love deep, unplanned conversations — the kind where you end up talking about everything and lose track
            of time.</p>

        <p>Hi, I'm Angel Gonzalez and I live in Guatemala City. It’s a beautiful country filled with culture, colors,
            and friendly people. You’ll find a lot of my culture if you come visit!</p>
