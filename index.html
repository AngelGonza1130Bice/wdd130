        <p>I’m a pretty curious person — I love learning new things all the time, whether it’s about technology, design,
            or
            writing. I’d say I’m calm, observant, and have a good sense of humor a bit sarcastic sometimes, but in a
            friendly way, in my free time, I like listening to music, watching movies, or going for walks while thinking
            about new ideas. I also really enjoy deep, unplanned conversations — the kind where you end up talking about
            everything and lose track of time.</p>
