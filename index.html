        <p>Hi, my name is Angel Gonzalez I’m a pretty curious person — I love learning a bit about everything, from
            history and science to art and technology. I
            work in something related to communication and writing, so I spend a lot of time reading, researching, In my
            free time, I like listening to music (lately a lot of indie and soft jazz), going for walks, or trying out
            new
            recipes. I also really enjoy deep conversations — the kind where you end up talking about life and forget
            what time it
            is.</p>
